			<h2 id="about"> About </h2>
			<p class="pcenter">
				Welcome to Planets.com, in this website, you can find information about
				our 8 lovely planets. Each planet page has in depth information about the planet
				in a neatly fashioned order and will come with a couple of images for you to 
				visually see the planet. You can expect to read the size, colours, orbits and
				other interesting facts about the planet. This page is also very easy to navigate,
				to your left is all the available information in a neat list and will direct
				you where you want to go by just a simple click.

			<h2 id="planets"> Planets </h2>
			<p class="pcenter"> 
				Plants are what we called those big ball objects floating around in space.
				Each planet is unique and no of them is exactly the same. In order for
				a ball like figure in space to be classified as a planet, it must follow 
				these basic rules. The object must orbit a star, it is large enough that
				its own gravity forms it into a sphere, and has cleared all the objects 
				in its orbital neighbourhood.
			</p>
			<h3 id="typeOfplanets"> Type of Planets </h3>
			<p class="pcenter"> 
				There are 2 main types of Planets we have in our solar system, rock planets
				and gas planets. Rock planets or "terrestrial" planets are the smaller
				planets consisting of Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. These planets are
				small and rocky and are the type of planets that are closet to the sun.
				The other type of planet is the gas planets or known as the "Jovian" 
				planets. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune fall into this category
				because they are planets with a lot of gas, hence the name "gas planets".
				These gas planets are also surrounded by many bits of ice and small rock 
				pieces and have many moons.
			</p>
			<h3 id="planetMoons"> Planet Moons </h3>
			<p class="pcenter"> 
				Not only are there planets in our solar system, these planets are also
				surrounded by many moons. You many already know that Earth has a moon,
				but did you know that other planets have moons too? All planets have 
				different types and sizes of moons, all but Mercury and Venus. Earth 
				has one moon, and its name is Luna. Mars also has some moons, 2
				of them in fact, are their names are Phobos and Deimos. Now we get 
				to the Jovian planets, which are known to have many moons surrounding 
				them. These planets may have many moons but most of them aren't even
				properly named. Jupiter has 67 moons, Saturn slipping just a little under with 
				62 moons, Uranus with 27 and finally Neptune with 14.  
			</p>
			<h3 id="whyDoplanets"> Why do Planets Exist? </h3>
			<p class="pcenter"> 
				In order to answer this question, it can be easily divided in to 2 other
				questions. "How did the Planets form?" and "Why did the Planets form?"
			</p>
			<h4 id="howDidplanets"> How did Planets form? </h4>
			<p class="pcenter"> 
				All long time ago, about 4.6 billion years ago, there was this spinning
				disc call the "Space Nebula" which consisted of many elements such as
				hydrogen and helium. When all these elements were spinning, some of the 
				elements would  collide into one and another and clump up to make chucks.
				Eventually these chucks go so big that it also started to pull other
				elements into it and cause it to form even bigger. These chucks got 
				big enough that its own gravitational pull started to make the chuck 
				form into a sphere, making the final product of what we now know as
				planets.
					</p>
			<h4 id="whyDidplanets"> Why did Planets form? </h4>
			<p class="pcenter"> 
				Some of the points are already answered in the "How did Planets form?"
				question but there is still more. You may know that planets formed 
				because of the "Space Nebula," but do you know what formed the "Space
				Nebula" in the first place? Kind of like how the planets formed, the
				same concept applies to the formation of nebulae. Nebulae form by 
				interstellar medium going through gravitational collapse. Same amounts
				of gravitational attraction make the matter in interstellar medium 
				to attract and clump together, forming regions of greater density.
				During this process of gravitational collapse, stars are able to form
				in the centre and start to form planets afterwards.

				<h2 id="mer"> Mercury </h2>
				<p class="pcenter">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(planet)"> Mercury </a>
					is the very first planet in our solar system and is also the smallest too.
					Being the first planet in our solar system, it also means it is the innermost
					planet separating itself from the sun at an average of 57.91 million km and 
					it take Mercury about 88 Earth days for it to complete its orbit around the 
					sun. Mercury was named after the Mercury, who was a Roman who sent messages to the
					gods and was given the symbol &#9791;.

				<h2 id="ven"> Venus </h2>
				<p class="pcenter">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus"> Venus </a>
					is the second planet in our solar system, which is about 108.2 million km
					away from the sun, and that's only the second planet! With this much of a distance, 
					it would take Venus about 224.7 Earth days for it to fully orbit all around the sun.
					Venus's symbol is &#9792; and it represents the Roman goddess of love and beauty, which was named
					to Venus due to its amazing colours.

				<h2 id="ear"> Earth </h2>
				<p class="pcenter">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth"> Earth </a>
					is the third planet in our solar system and is probably the planet we're most 
					familiar with because it is the planet we live on. Even though it is the planet we 
					live on, we might not know as much about it, but no worries, this is what Planets.com is for.
					First off, Earth is the only planet in the whole solar system that is able to sustain life on it, 
					mainly because it has all the sustainable needs for all living things, including water and oxygen.
					Earth is 149.6 million km away from the sun and takes 365.25 days for it to complete its full 
					orbit around the sun. Unlike any of the other planets, Earth was not named after and Greek or Roman
					god or goddess, but instead is referred as "the world" by the words of Greek; "Ta&#8150;a" and in Latin; "Terra,"
					and has the symbol &#9793;.

				<h2 id="mar"> Mars </h2>
				<p class="pcenter">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars"> Mars </a>
					is the fourth planet in the solar system and is the most similar
					to Earth as it shares similar size and weight. Mars is 227.9 million km away from 
					the sun, taking 687 days to fully orbit the sun and making it the fourth planet and is the last of the terrestrial planets. Mars 
					got its name from the Roman god of war, Mars, and often Mars is also referred as the "Red Planet."
					The symbol it was given is the &#9794; symbol and the arrow at the top right corner represents 
					the arrow or spear emerging from it as Mars was the god of war.

				<p class="pcenter">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter"> Jupiter </a>
					is the fifth planet our solar system and is also the first planet
					that is classified as Jovian planets in the solar system. It is has a distance of 778.5 million km 
					from the sun and being for far out, Jupiter takes nearly 12 years to orbit the whole sun! Being such a 
					huge planet and representing the largest planet, it's no wonder why the Roman people decided to name 
					it after their most important god, Jupiter and gave it this symbol, &#9795;.

				<h2 id="sat"> Saturn </h2>
				<p class="pcenter">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn"> Saturn </a>
					is the sixth planet in the solar system and is most famous for its many
					rings surrounding the planet. Saturn separates itself from the sun with an amazing
					1.429 billion km of space! This is also the first planet to have a distance of over 1 billion km
					However with this incredible distance, poor Saturn will have to wait 29 years until it 
					orbits 1 full turn around the sun. With the many rings Saturn has, it was named 
					after the Roman god of agriculture and given the symbol &#9796;, which represents the 
					sickle that the Roman god would use.

				<p class="pcenter">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranus"> Uranus </a>
					is the seventh planet in the solar system distancing itself from the sun
					with 2.877 billion km of space, causing Uranus the long wait of 84 years to complete
					one single orbit around the sun. Unlike all of the other planets named after Roman gods or
					goddess, Uranus was named after the Greek god of skies, Ouranos or &#9797;.

					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neptune"> Neptune </a>
					is the eighth and final planet in our solar system, which is the saved for the best.
					Obviously Neptune is the farthest planet from the sun as it is the last, but did you know that 
					Neptune does so by giving a huge 4.498 billion km of distance! No wonder Neptune has to take
					165 years to fully orbit the sun, by then, 3 generations have already gone by here on Earth.
					With the dark blue colours that Neptune brightly shows off, it was named after the Roman god of seas 
					and has the symbol &#9798;, which represent the god's trident.
